# chia-add-nodes
PowerShell script to add nodes (peer connections) to Chia

Sometimes connection status shows Not Synced or not connected to peers, especially when you have not configured incoming connections (Port Forward on port 8444).

This script will read the list of peers from chia.powerlayout.com and will attempt to add al them.

Usage: just run the script

Note: just a quick and simple script but it works for me...
